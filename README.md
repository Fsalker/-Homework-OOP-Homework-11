[RELEASE] Complex Numbers &amp; Algebra Matrix template classes for C++

## Complex Numbers

##### Features
- Add (+)
- Substract (-)
- Multiply (*)
- Divide (/)
- Compare (<)
- Read from stream (<<)
- Write in stream (>>)

## Algebra Matrix

##### Features

- Add (+)
- Substract (-)
- Multiply (*)
- Read from stream (<<)
- Write in stream (>>)
- Calculate Determinant
- Compute Submatrix by eliminating a row / column
- Compute Inverse Matrix

## Perspectives

The current code can be improved in several ways including, but not limited to:
- Moving the classes (complexNumber, matrix) into separated files.
- Writing better unit tests, especially for the Matrix class...
- Cleaning out main().
- Finishing code 'templatisation', specifically overloading '<<' and '>>' stream operators.
- Perhaps even providing a GUI, someday.

Feel free to use the current 'library' in your own projects.
